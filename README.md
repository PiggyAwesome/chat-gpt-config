### [ChatGPT Utilities by innaton.com](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-utilities-by-inna/gdaanompcnmhpbaogmddepcfnbdoimpl)
<blockquote>ChatGPT Utilities to make working with ChatGPT more efficient. Starting with a smart 'continue' button.
Initial Version of ChatGPT Utilities to make working with ChatGPT more efficient.
Starting with a smart "continue" button.

A "smart" continue button - forces ChatGPT to continue right from where it stopped. No more skipped, repeated, or malformed responses when working with long responses. 
Especially useful when dealing with code or long text responses.

Currently at a 90%+ success rate since the first release of ChatGPT.

(Still outperforming the official continue functionality released by OpenAI)

Example dynamic continue prompt:
"
Your last response stopped here:
\`\`\`
[LAST_FEW_LINES_BEFORE_STOP]
\`\`\`
Please continue.
"

Currently it uses pre-defined prompts, but in the future might allow the user to customise as needed.

If this get's enough traction and support, we might follow up with a larger and more powerful toolkit for ChatGPT.


Ideas for future versions:
- Button/prompt to accept large code as input and wait until all data is provided before initiating a conversation
- Special buttons/prompts for developers that are optimised for generating boiler-plate code for specific languages
- Export conversation to PDF
- Customisation of prompts used in any of the buttons
- Schedule and execute prompts (schedule multiple prompts and auto-continue)
